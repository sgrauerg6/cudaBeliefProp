Stereo Processing using optimized CUDA and optimized CPU belief propagation implementations
Code available at https://github.com/sgrauerg6/cudaBeliefProp
All stereo sets used in evaluation are from (or adapted from) Middlebury stereo datasets at https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/
"tsukubaSetHalfSize: tsukubaSet with half the height, width, and disparity count of tsukubaSet"
conesFullSizeCropped: 900 x 750 region in center of the reference and test cones stereo set images
Results shown in this comparison for each run are for total runtime including any time for data transfer between device and host
