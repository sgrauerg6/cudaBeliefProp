 Documentation of code for Optimized Belief Propagation (CPU and GPU)

Project page with code and README\+: \href{https://github.com/sgrauerg6/cudaBeliefProp}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/sgrauerg6/cuda\+Belief\+Prop}}

Code is structured such as evaluation portion is separate from implementation and also using parent/child classes in the belief propagation implementation so the CPU/\+GPU implementations share the same code where possible; the framework is there to add optimized belief propagation implementations for additional architectures and also to use the evaluation code for evaluation of other benchmarks.
